# Use NLP to Master Search in Japanese (and all other languages)

In this workshop we'll cover many of the complexities that make string search in Japanese so difficult. 
In the process you'll learn how to use the NLP (Natural Language Processing) features of the iOS SDK
to make impressive search algorithms, not only in Japanese, but any language.
